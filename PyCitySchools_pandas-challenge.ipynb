    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "District Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the district's performance includes the following key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Total Number of Unique Schools: 15\n",
    "    Total Students: 39,170\n",
    "    Total Budget: $24,649,428.00\n",
    "    Average Math Score: 78.99\n",
    "    Average Reading Score: 81.88\n",
    "    % Passing Math: 75.00%\n",
    "    % Passing Reading: 85.81%\n",
    "    % Overall Passing: 65.17%\n",
    "\n",
    "School Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Each schoolâ€™s performance was evaluated on various metrics, including average test scores and percentage of students passing math and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Cabrera High School: 91.33%\n",
    "    2. Thomas High School: 90.94%\n",
    "    3. Griffin High School: 90.62%\n",
    "    4. Wilson High School: 90.54%\n",
    "    5. Pena High School: 90.54%\n",
    "\n",
    "Lowest Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    15. Rodriguez High School: 80.74%\n",
    "    14. Figueroa High School: 80.20%\n",
    "    13. Huang High School: 76.63%\n",
    "    12. Johnson High School: 76.45%\n",
    "    11. Ford High School: 77.10%\n",
    "\n",
    "Math Scores by Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "The average math scores for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) were calculated for each school. Generally, the math scores tend to remain relatively consistent across the grade levels within each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading Scores by Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the average reading scores for each grade level were calculated for each school, with results showing consistent performance across different grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores by School Spending\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of school performance based on spending per student reveals:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Schools with lower spending per student (<$585) have slightly lower average scores and passing rates compared to schools with higher spending ($645-$680).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores by School Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of school performance based on school size shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Smaller schools (<1000 students) tend to have higher average scores and passing rates compared to larger schools (2000-5000 students).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores by School Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis based on school type (Charter vs. District) indicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Charter schools have higher average scores and passing rates compared to district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observable Trends and Conclusions\n",
    "1. School Size and Performance:\n",
    "    Conclusion: Smaller schools tend to perform better than larger schools. Schools with fewer than 1000 students had higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher percentages of students passing both subjects compared to larger schools. This trend suggests that smaller schools might offer a more personalized and focused educational environment, contributing to better student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. School Type and Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Conclusion: Charter schools outperform district schools. The data shows that charter schools have higher average math and reading scores and higher percentages of students passing these subjects compared to district schools. This could be attributed to different teaching methodologies, administrative flexibility, or resource allocation in charter schools that may enhance student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conclusions highlight important factors that influence student performance and provide insights that could inform decisions for educational policy and resource allocation."
